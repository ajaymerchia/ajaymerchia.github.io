					<h1> How it all started </h1>

				<div class="row">
					<h4>Getting Started</h4>
					<p class="bottom-space">
						Real Estate for me started back in high school. Initially, I
						 simply wanted to help my mother out with her own real estate
						 business. She had just started out and I decided to join her on her
						 prospecting. I grew to enjoy walking around and speaking with neighbors
						 about their lives, their current housing situations, and slipping in
						 the occasional pitch.

						  <br><br>

							As my mom got her first couple of leads, I listened in on the process.
							When "the first couple" turned to dozens, I wanted to be a part of
							the process myself. I would wake up on the weekends to go strategically
							place Open House signs on the road. I would help with contract preparation.
							I did whatever I could to help my mom spend more time with her clients, and
							less time doing contract prep work and paperwork.
							<br><br>

							Soon, I gained interest in the market itself. What determined prices? How did
							my mom know how much a home would sell before before it even sold? Why was Redfin
							and Zillow so wrong all the time about sale prices?

							Armed with curiosity and a technical background, I quickly developed my skills in
							market price estimation using data analysis techniques from school. Furthermore,
							I grew stronger at inspecting properties, determining their appraisal value, and
							identifying tide-changing contract terms. I sought my license.
					</p>

					<h4>Practicing</h4>
					<p class="bottom-space">
						 My license was proudly filed with Intero. Now came the hardwork.
						 I spent a great deal of time going through the same process as I did
						 in high school. Prospecting, finding open houses to host, working with
						 clients. It was a huge step up from filling out paperwork and doing the
						 market research. <br><br>

						 Needless to say, I began to grow my real estate identity. I closed 5
						 transactions that summer. I learned a great deal about salesmanship, as
						 well as empathy and much more about the inner workings of the real estate process.
						 <br><br>
						 The experience had a profound impact on me and served me well in writing one of
						 the essays which led to my acceptance to the Haas School of Business. You can
						 read that essay <a style="color: #5cc0b9"href="finearts">here</a>.
