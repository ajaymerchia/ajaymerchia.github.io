				Priya Sundaresh & Priya Agarwal were both lead choreographers of Azaad when I was on the team.
        As both graduated, they pulled together generations of Azaad and Zahanat for one last performance.

        For Priya Sundaresh's video shoot, we arrived at an abanoned SF warehouse, greeted by stray cats, broken glass bottles,
				and stark skepticism. We got to sweeping and got ready to dance to Muqabala.
        <br><br>
        For Priya Agarwal's video shoot, we arrived at the Berkeley Marina, greeted by kites, heavy winds, and potholes. Nonetheless,
        we powered through and make the video work against all odds.

			<h3>Azaad</h4>
				<p class="top-space" style="color: white; text-align: justify">
					Azaad taught me A LOT. If there's any part of my life in dance that defines growth, improvement, resillience,
					strength, and learning, it's through Azaad. When I first joined Azaad my freshmen year, I came in surrounded
					mostly by other boys who had already been trained for a year. Naturally, I wanted to be on par, so I took extra
					care to ensure that I would be a comparable dancer.
					<br><br>
					I put in countless extra hours, even throughout the cuts on
					my toes and the concussions from stunts. By the end of my freshmen year, I had had one crazy year of success, but,
					by the end of the year, none of the guys wanted to return. I wanted to come back another year. Not necessarily to win,
					but to give back to Azaad and give them models that I had when I joined. End of my freshmen year, I was elected captain.
					<br><br>
					We had 5 returners. A team of 26 down to 5. I still gave my all to that year and it taught me so much. I wasn't the most
					social person going into the year, but with the requisite of leadership came the development of critical social skills.
					I learned to manage a brand new team of 23. I learned to balance the importance of the organization's goals with the individual
					attention that each member needs and deserves.
					<br><br>
					As a props director, one of the biggest take aways was the importance of prototyping. We took on the incredible feat of building
					a ginormous 8 foot mirror out of shatter-proof materials. In other words, we built a huge mirror using reflective paper and wood,
					and then figured out how to collapse it into a couple of duffel bags. I couldn't have been prouder of us. We actually made it work
					(see the videos onstage below). It didn't come easy though. We had over 8 small scale prototypes and 2 large scale prototypes before
					we got to the point where we could assemble 3 of them from scratch in 3 hours.
					<br><br>
					Above all, the biggest lesson I took away was that leadership is not about self-sacrifice. That all came crashing down at the last
					competition of the year. I had been on about 2-3 hours of sleep for the whole semester. I knew I was not performing my best, but I
					thought it was okay because at least my teammates would be in solid condition. I was wrong. My body gave out on me after months of
					exhaustion and injuries. During our last practice of the year, I twisted my ankle/tore a ligament. I couldn't dance. I couldn't perform.
					The team I was working so hard to take stress off of had to stay up 4 extra hours because of me. I was one of the male leads. Storytelling,
					dancing, formations, stunts, much of it revolved around me, now they had to redo all of it. The team was exhausted going into the competition.
					<br><br>
					Leadership is just not about doing what's best for the team. It's about doing what's best for the team <i> and</i> you.

					<h2>10 Lessons From College</h2>
					<i><p>The Ups and Downs</p></i>
					<hr style="border-color: #bbb">
				</div>
				<p class="bottom-space">
					I. Don't act like you know what you're doing. You don't. Take the time to explore and find what you love before you settle in.
					<br><br>
					II. Don't let anyone dictate what the 'right' path is. It is whatever you <i>feel</i> is right.
					<br><br>
					III. Be direct, but kind. Especially with housemates and roommates, letting things seethe is never the answer.
					<br><br>
					IV. Just go with the flow. Things are going to go wrong, but as long as you stay happy through the process, it will be fine.
					<br><br>
					V. Make the most of every second. Your wasting no one's time but your own by flipping through Buzzfeed in those 10 minutes before class starts.
					<br><br>
					VI. Go to lecture. It's easy to shirk responsibility in college, but as soon as you tell yourself its okay, it's a slippery slope to failure.
					<br><br>
					VII. Peer pressure is easy to give into. It can be hard to stay in and work when your friends are going out or up to other activities. Know what's important to you and stick to it.
					<br><br>
					VIII. Finding a balance is hard. Work, Life, School, Social, all these worlds will compete for your time. Segmenting by the minute/hour is much worse than the day/week.
					<br><br>
					IX. Take care of yourself first. You can't do anything without your health. Sleep off sickness, go to the doctor, do what you need to do to feel better because when you get back to it you'll be 10x efficient.
					<br><br>
					X. It's fast. Don't let yourself waste a moment of it. Being a student is a prilivelge. There's so much you have access to as a student. Cherish it before its gone.

					<h2>Haas Humility Essay</h2>
					<i><p>Submitted for Admission to Haas School of Business</p></i>
					<hr style="border-color: #bbb">
				</div>
				<p class="bottom-space">
					Humility (noun): Recognizing and accepting blame for failures and taking action to prevent them in the future.
					<br><br>
					Humility has been a struggle for me since I was 2. My parents show me home videos where it is clear that I love being the center of attention. My brother would be singing and I would jump in front of the camera to show off my beautifully nasal voice. I was the first-born; I believed I was the most adorned. With that came confidence – maybe a bit too much.
					<br><br>
					I grew up with extreme confidence in the belief that hard work always prevails. I believed I controlled my destiny and my success down to the last variable. But that’s seldom the case.
					<br><br>
					I took an interest in real estate in high school and by Summer of 2017, I was working as a realtor for Intero. That’s when I realized: I couldn’t control everything.
					<br><br>
					I was working with my first client. The market was hot living next to Apple in Cupertino, and he was in love with a home listed for $1.45M. By the book, it seemed like I did everything right: I researched comparable properties, read inspection reports, gauged the market from the listing agent and open houses. But it all fell apart in the end.
					<br><br>
					Even after proving the house would sell over $1.55M, he still felt $1.4M was competitive. I knew how much he wanted this home. His daughter had already picked out her room, they loved the neighborhood, it was the home for them. I didn’t want to make him uncomfortable. I was understanding and empathetic, and we wrote the offer.
					<br><br>
					The home sold for $1.58M.
					<br><br>
					That was a big loss to me. As tempting as it might be to blame the client for not understanding the market, I had to acknowledge, that was my fault. I didn’t communicate properly. I realized I couldn’t control every variable. I spent days rethinking how I could’ve done things differently. My dog must’ve thought I was crazy with all the speeches he had to listen to. Then it hit me.
					<br><br>
					The next time, I didn’t present the sale price based on research. I let them conduct their own guided analysis. I showed them how to use real estate tools. My research manifested as advice and instruction, but the decision was ultimately theirs. It was a fusion of learning and professional advice that made them feel respected and valued. Since the shift in strategy, my clients have not lost a single offer.
					<br><br>
					I realized humility requires recognizing your failures and actually working to improve it. Often that involves stepping away from your ego and knowledge and giving ownership of processes to others. There’s no perfect way to share ideas. Everyone thinks differently. But if I orient my advice through humility, I can build a collaborative community where we work together to analyze situations, not a competitive one. I can build nursery for ideas, not a battleground.
